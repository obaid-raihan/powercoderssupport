            Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" 
            (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. 
            This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance.

            Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. 
            It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old.
